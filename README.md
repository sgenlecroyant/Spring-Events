### Spring events can help you build loose-coupled applications by separating your business logic
### from events happing in your application like: sending emails on Slack, Gmail, and even use the WhatsApp APIs to
### send WhatsApp messages.

### The App will be running on the local server: 8080
### The Database used in this project is the H2 database since it is lightweight and 
### very convenient for development and testing purpose

##### 2. the password that you see in the configuration file can be used by humans, since it cannot be be used  
######   for the Multi-Factor Authentication and i can REVOKE IT ANYTIME
